Project delivery

The project is an Automod simulation of a drive-in.

The complete description of the project can be found in the file named "technical report.pdf" of this same folder.

Ad-hoc 3D models were developed for the project, which must be inserted manually in the respective Automod folder before the execution. 
The steps to follow to include them are:
- access the "custom models" folder of the current directory
- copy all models contained in this folder into the appropriate Automod folder (which is usually located at the path "C:\AutoMod\12_6\demos\graphics\cell").
Once these steps have been performed, the project can be executed correctly.

The folder "python scripts" includes the code to generate the data we used during the simulations. More details about these scripts can be found in the report.
