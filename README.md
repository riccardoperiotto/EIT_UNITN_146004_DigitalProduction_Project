#  Digital production and logistics systems mod. 2 [146004]#
## Project

Delivered project for the Digital Production and logistics systems mod. 2 course of the master degree in Autonomous System (EIT), University of Trento.

The project aim was to create a digital twin of a production system using the simulation software Automod. 
The whole description of the project is contained in the file named "technical report.pdf" of this same repository.
The underlying production system is a drive-in and the main points we focused on are: the production process itself, the order and menu management, the menu delivery, the restocking policy for the production station and the overall waiting time reduction.

Ad-hoc 3D models were developed for the project, which must be inserted manually in the respective Automod folder before the execution. 
The steps to follow to include them are:
- access the "custom models" folder of the current directory
- copy all models contained in this folder into the appropriate Automod folder (which is usually located at the path "C:\AutoMod\12_6\demos\graphics\cell").
Once these steps have been performed, the project can be executed correctly.

The folder "python scripts" includes the code to generate the data we used during the simulations. More details about these scripts can be found in the report.
